# Our Projects

# Training Workshops

We offer [`training workshops`](http://oscnigeria.org/training) to teach researchers the data science skills they need to examine their own data. Participants are introduced to the R programming language and to cutting-edge technologies used in single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing data analysis. All of our training materials are openly licensed and freely available!

* [Sign up to be notified about future training workshops.](https://share.hsforms.com/) 
* Questions? Interested in using our materials to hold your own workshop? Contact us at [`training@oscnigeria.org`](mailto:training@oscnigeria.org).
