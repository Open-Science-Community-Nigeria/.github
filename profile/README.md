## Welcome to @Open Science Community Nigeria (OSCN)!

# About Us 

Inspired by the Open Science (OS) movements that focuses on making science more open, improves the quality, accessibility, and efficiency of science and education through facilitating access to academic content and encouraging its reuse, [The Open Science Community Nigeria](https://www.oscnigeria.org/) was established in April 2022 as a scientist-driven nonprofit organisation working to embed open science principles and practices, promote openness, transparency and reproducibility in science among scientists, network of researchers and societal stakeholders in Nigeria. 

Our mission is to interact with newcomers and experienced peers, inspire each other to adopt open science practices and values, identify opportunities and pitfalls, and provide feedback on policies, infrastructure, and support services as does in other regions of the World. We aim to specifically target scientists, researchers and students who are passionate about open science but have little to no experience with open science principles and practices.


# Our Projects

# Training Workshops

We offer [`training workshops`](http://oscnigeria.org/training) to teach scientists, researchers,  the data science skills they need to examine their own data. Participants are introduced to the R programming language and to cutting-edge technologies used in single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing data analysis. All of our training materials are openly licensed and freely available!
